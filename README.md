Anki Deck for Principles of Economics 201

Hello, I've created this deck of flashcards for use in our class.  I'm slowly updating it as I go through the material so check back frequently if your deck is not fully up-to-date.  

# **Installation**
In order to use the deck you will need the Anki program (it is free and open source): https://apps.ankiweb.net


After installing Anki you can download the .apk file from this repository and click "Import File" which can be found at the bottom of the Anki window.

# **Using the Deck**
Once you have imported deck you can simply click on it and press 'Study Now.'  

Currently I have the cards divided by chapter (I've been going back and forth between both books), if you want to study an individual chapter you can select 'Custom Study' and select 'Study by State or Tag.'  I may consider breaking them up by module in future updates if I find that's easier to follow.

# **About Anki**
Anki uses Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect.
